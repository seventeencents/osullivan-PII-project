# Overview

This repository houses a spam email classification data science project. Within the file structure of the project you'll find copies of the datasets used, which can be originally found [here on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naserabdullahalam/phishing-email-dataset/data?select=CEAS_08.csv), code files for loading/cleaning/exploring/visualizing the datasets, in addition to a machine learning classification model process. 

# Pre-requisites

This particular data science project exclusively makes use of the R programming language and Quarto files for mixed code and results sharing. While this isn't an exhaustive list, many of the most popular R data wrangling, visualization, and language modeling packages (such as tidyverse, ggplot2, caret, etc.) are utilized throughout this project and are necessary for reproducing or replicating the work found within. 

# Getting started

In order to get started please see the project manuscript located within the `./products/manuscript` folder. This manuscript file will serve as the formal project report as well as an extensive resource in understanding the various code files and figure locations that are at play in ultimately producing and presenting the project findings.
