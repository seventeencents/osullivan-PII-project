# data

The folders inside this folder contain all of the data at various stages.

This data is being loaded/manipulated/changed/saved with code from the `code` folders.

You should place the raw data found at the original Kaggle source in the `raw-data` folder. This has been omitted from the GitHub due to storage size concerns. The `.gitignore` file should exclude the files by default once supplied to the `raw-data` folder. However a smaller `.rds` copy of the data has been left on GitHub in lieu of the original files.

Processed data generated by the `processingcode.R` file is located in the `processed-data` folder.
